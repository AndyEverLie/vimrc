Vim as a PHP IDE
===

Installation:
git@github.com:renownedmedia/Vim-PHP-IDE.git
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

This Vim configuration is meant to be used to make Vim act more like an IDE. I use it mostly under MacVIM,
so some things may be weird in different environments. For now, I'm just planning on using github to make
managing my VIM configuraiton more easy, especially with deploying it to different environments. I'm not
sure if I will make this a community projects.
